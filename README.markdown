Enhanced Node API
-------------

I enhanced the api browser of node.JS a bit. I added a live filter box
in the upper left corner, which filters all the api content and shows
only the content, which matches your text.

Like the node.JS' original doc.js it uses jQuery and works 100% client
side. It's just a replacement for the doc.js-file. Its licensed under the terms of MIT.
